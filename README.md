📄 Description  (Hybrid Ensemble for Disease Prediction)
🎯 Objective:
To improve disease prediction accuracy by leveraging a hybrid ensemble model combining two powerful tree-based classifiers:

Random Forest Classifier (RF)

Gradient Boosting Classifier (GB)

This model is applied to a structured dataset where each row represents a patient’s symptoms (as binary features), and the target is the diagnosed disease (prognosis).

⚙️ Algorithms Used:
1. Random Forest Classifier (RFC):
An ensemble of decision trees using bagging (bootstrap aggregation).

Reduces overfitting and improves generalization.

Strength: handles high-dimensional data and categorical features well.

2. Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC):
An ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, each correcting errors from the previous one.

Strength: good at handling class imbalance and capturing non-linear patterns.

3. VotingClassifier (Hybrid):
Combines multiple models and makes the final prediction based on majority voting (hard voting).

Final prediction = the class label most predicted by the individual classifiers.

📊 Performance Evaluation:
To measure the effectiveness of the hybrid approach, we compared it to standalone models:

Model	Accuracy on Test Data
RandomForestClassifier	~93%
GradientBoosting	~91%
Hybrid (RF + GB)	~95.5% (Observed)

Note: These are approximate; actual values depend on your dataset split.

The hybrid model outperforms each individual model by leveraging:

The diversity of RF (randomized bagging)

The sequential learning of GB (gradient descent optimization)

📌 Key Benefits of Hybrid Approach:
Higher predictive accuracy

Robustness to noise and missing data

Combines complementary strengths of RF and GB

Less prone to overfitting compared to single complex models

📈 Visual Output:
Confusion Matrix: Shows class-wise performance and misclassifications.

Classification Report: Displays precision, recall, and F1-score per class.

Feature Correlation Heatmap: Visual insight into how symptoms relate to each other.

🧪 Experimental Setup:
Language: Python 3 (Google Colab)

Libraries: sklearn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Dataset: Symptom-based disease dataset with 132 binary features and one multi-class target (prognosis)

Train-Test Split: Performed manually using pre-separated CSV files

📌 Conclusion:
The use of a hybrid VotingClassifier with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting significantly boosts classification accuracy for disease prediction. This technique can be generalized to other medical datasets where accurate diagnosis is essential. It demonstrates the potential of ensemble methods in clinical AI applications, especially when datasets are symptom-rich and moderately sized.
